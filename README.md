# Libraries and technologies used:
- Django
- Crispy forms
- Cloudinary
- Bootstrap
- Python
- Elephant Sql
- Heroku


# Purpose:
The intension of my Gamewise-blog was to demonstrate the skills I have acquired during this phase of the full stack development course. The blog was developed to illustrate my proficiency in building a fully functional Django blog with interactive features, catering for both the administrative and user perspectives.

#

# My blog:
The creation of my Gamewise-blog was propelled by the intention of facilitating the collaborative convergence of mental health and gaming. This aimed to establish a protected and all-inclusive environment where cohorts could meet and communicate freely concerning their personal experiences with mental health.  Through the integration of these two distinct domains, the blog sought to create a platform which encourages open dialogue, fosters a sense of safety, and demonstrates that a sense of comfort can be found in the most unlikely places. 

#

# Features of my blog
- Here is a selection of screenshots which illustrates<br> the diverse mechanisms imbedded within my blog.

#

# UX/UI
The blog was created to show my programming knowledge of Django, Html, User stories,<br> Issues Agile development, Python testing and Api's.

#

# Requirements 
- Corresponds to all screen sizes and devices.
- Accessible and user friendly blog.
- User friendly and clear navigation methods.

#

# Expectations 
- Every part of my blog is functional as intended.
- Each  button is functional and corresponded accordingly when pressed.
- Responsive on all devices irrespective of users choice.
- All functions worked as they should and in a clear and concise manner.

#

# Design:
My intension was to formulate a blog which encompassed simplicity and visual comfort. Each component was carefully constructed to foster readability and clarity. The user interface provided a straightforward concept for creating, editing, and adapting changes effortlessly. Furthermore, it was designed so users could easily read, like and communicate with other usersâ€™ posts. I optimised visual perception through the use of black text accompanied by red boxes, which enhances the viewing experience. 

#

# Functionality
* All buttons and links have been hovered over and clicked on to ensure accessibility.
* All pages load correctly across all device screen sizes (Please see testing section).
* Functional buttons worked as intended and on different device screen sizes.

#
#

# Testing:
## Lighthouse test:
* This is the lighthouse testing for my blog on all three pages used Homepage, Register and Login<br>

# Bugs and errors:
I had so many bugs and errors on this project, here is a list of them and the solutions i encorperated.

- Error 404 page not found = (Solution) It was I had not linked my paths properly in my settings.py

- CSS not working on Heroku = (Solution) I had not changed debug to false before deployment

- Server 500 = (Solution) there was a problem in my json file with the superuser deleted that user and replaced it with a new one.

- html pages not found = (Solution) This was a big one as it made my whole code error i changed a file name from blog to games, i didnt realise every where on the code i needed to change blog to games in each py file.

- Images not loading = (Solution) Realised it was the I was using it didnt seem to be compatible with gitpod so all the images errored changed the site and they worked perfectly.

- Build fail on heroku = (Solution) When I deployed through heroku the build failed not sure why just disconnected the app and re-deployed and it worked.

- Indentation errors = (Solution) Simple spelling mistakes that were easily fixed.

- Fields.E305 error = (Solution) Screenshot provided ![Alt text](assets/screenshots/error%20image.jpg) This one took a lot to figure out I realised the name on the related path was to similar. So i replaced the names with a universal + sign and it fixed the error.
