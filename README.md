# Libraries and technologies used:

# Purpose:
The purpose of the Gamewise-blog was to demonstrate the new skills<br> I have learned in this part of the full stack development course. To show I could create a django<br> blog that was fully functional and was also interactive from an admin point of view and a user point of view.

#

# My blog:
My blog is a gaming and mental health blog were people can come that about <br> everything to do with the gaming world and whats going on in thier head to break<br> down barriers and let people know its always good to talk no matter whats going on in thier life.

#

# UX/UI
The quiz was created to show my programming knowledge Django, Html, User stories,<br> Issues Agile development, Python testing and Api's.

#

# Requirements 
- Corresponds to all screen sizes and devices.
- Accessible and user friendly blog.
- User friendly and clear navigation methods.

#

# Expectations 
- Every part of my quiz worked as it was meant to.
- Each  button worked functionally when it was pressed and brought the user to the correct page.
- For it to be responsive regardless of what device the user chose to be on.
- All functions worked as they should in a clear and concise manner.

#

# Design:
My design idea was to keep it simple and easy on the eye<br>every part is readible and clear. SImple way as a user to create, edit and delete your<br> own pages as you please. to also like and comment on others posts easliy.

#

# Functionality

* All pages load correctly across all device screen sizes (Please see testing section).
* Functional buttons worked as intended and on different device screen sizes.
